# Quasar
A library for creating "virtual" Minecraft servers in Lua.  
Supports Minecraft 1.21.7/8 (protocol 772). If you wish to support clients of other (older) versions, use a proxy in front of the server.

Currently in development, not ready for normal usage.

# Features
- Players joining & seeing eachother
- Chunk loading from region files
- Block breaking/placing, persistent through client chunks unloading
- Authentication/Encryption, player skins & skin layers
- Player animations (arm swing, shifting)
- Entities spawnable
- Multiple dimensions & players able to travel between them
- Vanilla Registry data, incl. block states, items, packets, etc.

# Planned features
- Chunk generation (very simple terrain) (in progress)
- Survival block breaking
- Helper for block placing from items (item id & facing -> blockstate)
- Item GUIs
- [Dialogs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dialog)
  - Lua state inspector using dialogs
- Command syntax tree
- Removing Copas (and thus LuaSec) dependency (perhaps it remains as an option?)

## back burner planned features
- Chunk saving?
- Actual inventories (with items)
  - Survival inventory support (moving items)
  - Chest/external inventories (moving items within & between)
  - Creative inventory support
- Entity behavior framework (easier control of entity movement, animations, interactions)
- Optional implementation of performance-critical components in C (Connection, Chunk, NBT?, Anvil?)
- Dimensions in their own threads w/ Lua Lanes or similar (optional)
- Dimensions distributed across multiple physical computers? (perhaps best left to proxy software & just transferring the player)
